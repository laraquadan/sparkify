# sparkify
Big Data analysis using pyspark 
In this project Spark MLlib is used to build a machine learning model with large dataset. Sparkify is a music streaming service just as Spotify and Pandora. The analised dataset consist of log data for user usage of sparkify system. Sparkify is system for users to listen to songs by different artists. The target of the classification model is to predict churn, whick happens for both paid and free users. The system should be able to predict if a specific user will choose to cancel his registration. The analysis is preformed on a small dataset and run locally on the machine. To train the full dataset the program should be run using a cloud service such as AWS which is not implemented here. 

# Files
The following files can be downloaded to start working on the project:
- sparkify.ipynb: jupyter notebook containing the data analysis and the training.
- sparkify.html: html version of the notebook
- sparkify.pdf: pdf version of the notebook
- mini_sparkify_event_data.json: 128 MB json file contains the minified set of data 

# Aknowledgment
This project is a capstone project of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program.
